# Grayscale-conversion-app
Grayscale conversion desktop app done using C# and asm.
Allows the user to convert the original color .bmp file to its grayscale version.

C# GUI allows to set app parameters (C# or assembly based DLL, number of threads, file name, image preview). Dynamic Libraries handle everything else.
